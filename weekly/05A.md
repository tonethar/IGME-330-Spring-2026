## III. Previous Assignments
- See "overall feedback" grade comments (in myCourses) for **Week 3B - Takehome Quiz**
- Review: [Canvas 2D Essential Skills #2 - Paths & Lines & Arcs](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/2-canvas-paths-lines-arcs.md)
  - actually, we'll just review the "path building" concepts later on in the class when we look at [Canvas 2D Essential Skills #6 - Review & More About Paths](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/6-review-and-more-about-paths.md) 
- Review: [PE-05 - Canvas Screensaver](../pe/pe-05.md)
  - helper functions written for you - `getRandomColor()` and `getRandomInt(min, max)` 
  - writing your own helper functions:
    - `drawRectangle(ctx,x,y,width,height,fillStyle="black",lineWidth=0,strokeStyle="black")`
    - `drawArc(ctx,x,y,radius,fillStyle="black",lineWidth=0,strokeStyle="black", startAngle=0,endAngle=Math.PI * 2)`
    - `drawLine(ctx,x1,y1,x2,y2,lineWidth=1,strokeStyle="black")`
  - our helper functions utilized the  ["drawing state stack"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/save#the_drawing_state) and [`ctx.save()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/save) / [`ctx.restore()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/restore)
  - getting coordinates of mouse clicks with `canvasClicked()`
  - rectangles the hard way - `ctx.beginPath()`, [`ctx.rect()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/rect), `ctx.closePath()`
  - [`window.requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)
