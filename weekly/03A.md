# Week 3A

## I. Previous Assignment
- [PE-03 - Review `XHR` & Parsing Text/CSV/XML](../pe/pe-03.md) - will review when we cover JSON, below

---

## II. Upcoming HW Assignments
- [PE-04 - loading and parsing JSON files](../pe/pe-04.md)
- [HW-1 - Technobabble - Ultimate Version](../hw/hw-1.md)
  - we have covered "wrapper" functions, template strings, arrow functions 
  - still need ES6 modules & XHR/JSON - as mentioned, will cover these below

---

## III. JSON Notes
- We will be looking at these notes (the assignment due before next time) - [PE-04 - loading and parsing JSON files](../pe/pe-04.md)
  - but the code we will be writing today won't look like what is in this assignment, so be sue to complete the assignment on your own after class!

### III-A. JS Looping

***Let's review several ways of using loops to create the "pet name" HTML***

- First, a standard `for` loop:

```js
let html = "";
for (let i=0; i< myArray.length; i++){
  html += `<p>${myArray[i]}</p>`;
}
content.innerHTML = html;
```

- Next, a `for..of` loop:

```js
let html = "";
for (let item of myArray){ // Don't need a counter, NICE!
  html += `<p>${item}</p>`;
}
content.innerHTML = html;
```

- Finally, the way we did it in the HW, [`array.map()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) and [`array.join()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join)
- longer way:

```js
const paraFunc = item => `<p>${item}</p>`;
const htmlArray = myArray.map(paraFunc);
const htmlString = htmlArray.join("");
content.innerHTML = htmlString;
```

- short way:

```js
content.innerHTML = myArray.map(item => `<p>${item}</p>`).join("");
```

### III-B. `Array.filter()`

## IV. ES6 Modules

<!--
- [2B Checkoff - adding ES6 modules to **DoubleIt**](./02B.md#vi-2b-checkoff)
  - [ES6 Module Notes](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/ES6-module-pattern-2225.md)
  - [export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) and [import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)
  - Here is another nice reference with examples- https://javascript.info/import-export
  - Note that you can export a symbol (function, class, or variable) right when you declare it - example:
    - `export const doubleIt = num => num * 2;`
  - OR at the botton of the file like this:
    - `export { doubleIt };`
  - Let's look at `default` exports/imports - which are used when you are only exporting a single symbol from a file, such as a `class` definition
  - Let's also look at "name-spaced" imports, which are useful when you are importing a lot of functions and want to make it clear what file they came from. Example:
    - `import * as utils from "./utils.js"`
  - Something to keep in mind, ES6 modules (similar to classes and OOP practices) are "for people/programmers" - and NOT for the computer
    - the computer doesn't care if all of your code is jammed in one file and the variables and functions are named nonsensically - no matter how your code is structured computers only see 1's and zeroes
    - code organization, modules, OOP etc are there solely to help developers write better code with fewer b ugs, and to more easily maintain/update it
