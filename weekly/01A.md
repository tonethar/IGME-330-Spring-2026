# Week 1A

## I. Course Description

**Official description from SIS**
*This course provides students the opportunity to explore the design and development of media-rich web applications that utilize both static and procedurally manipulated media such as text, images and audio. This course examines client and server-side web development and features common to such applications. Issues explored include framework characteristics, information management, presentation, interactivity, persistence, and data binding. Programming projects are required.*

## II. Course Topics
- Foundational JavaScript Review
  - *~~`var`~~*, `let`, `const` & variable scope/lifetime
  - Primitive (value) Types: String, Number
  - Reference types: Objects (including arrays, DOM elements, other built in objects)
  - Iteration: `for`, `for...of`, `for...in`, `array.forEach()`
  - Comparison operators: `==` v. `===` & `!==`, `<`, `<=` etc ...
  - Functions - parameters & return values, default arguments
  - More functions - anonymous functions, arrow functions
- CSS Review
  - CSS selectors - type, class, id, attribute, sibling, child
  - CSS Media Queries

## III. Slack & Syllabus 
- Course Slack channel is here: https://rit-igme-330-05-2255.slack.com/
  - POST an intro! See myCourses for due date
- See syllabus in under myCourses **Content** tab
  - note the attendance policy
  - AND the late assignment policy + "Late Submission Dropbox" in myCourses
  - AND the Academic Integrity policy - *do your own work ...*
- Generative AI can hurt your learning!
  - In this course, we will be utilizing some of these tools to *research concepts*
  - NOT for generating code that is copy/pasted verbatim and without thought or understanding on the part of the user (meaning student OR prof)
  - [GPT example](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Fall-2023/blob/main/notes/gpt-3.5-example.md)
- But in the real world, of course you be using Gen AI to build software! Once we move through the core content of this course, we will be using Gen AI during class in ways like this:
  - have it coach us in how to add reactive features and data binding to the TechnoBabble HW
  - utilize it to brainstorm how to add a "plug in" architecture to the Audio Visualizer HW
  - have it explain the concept of HTTP headers to us
  - use it to write unit tests for an exercise

- 1. What is JavaScript?
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
  - Used on both the client-side and server-side to create interactive web applications
  - Weakly typed:
    - after they are declared, variables can contain any type
    - JS uses *dynamic typing* to verify the type safety of a program at runtime, as opposed to compile time (static) typing
  - Multi-Paradigm:
    - *imperative* - a series of commands that describe how the program behaves (as opposed to *declarative* languages such as CSS or SQL)
    - *functional* - use functions to compose a program, avoid globals & mutable state
    - *event-driven* - program flow is driven by user and system events
    - *object-based* 
      - the *object literal* - letting us create objects directly, without having to `class` a class first
      - many built-in objects to use - ex. `String`, `Number`, `Array`, `Math`, `Date`, `Map`, `Set`, ...
      - both *prototypical* and *classical inheritance* when the developer creates their own objects
      - *duck typed* - an object's suitability to be used for particular purpose is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the type of the object itself
- 2. JavaScript in the console - Review & Demo
  - the console is an interactive **REPL** - "Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop"
    - shift-enter for multi-line code
    - up arrow to repeat last typed line
  - declaring variables with `let` and `const`
  - operators
  - data types:
    - `Boolean`, `Number`, `String`, `Null`, `Undefined`, `Symbol` (new for ES6) and `BigInt` (really new)
    - and `Object`
    - Reference: 
      - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures
      - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects
  - `document.querySelector()` and `document.querySelectorAll()`
  - `console.log()`

<hr>

## V. Greeter Demo - Starter Code

- Name the file **`<yourLastname>-<yourFirstInitial>-greeter.html`** 
  - ex. "Ace Coder" would name their file **coder-a-greeter.html**

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Greeter</title>
    <style>
      *{font-size:1.5em;}
    </style>
    <script>
    
    // 1 - get a reference to the button
    // 2 - add a click event to button that calls a `sayHello` function
    // 3 - create a `sayHello()` function
    // 3A - get name of person from the <input>
    // 3B - get a reference to the #output <p>
    // 3C - update HTML of #output <p>
    
    </script>
  </head>
<body>
  <button>Click Me!</button>
  <input id="input-firstname" placeholder="Type in your name">
  <p id="output">???</p>
</body>
</html>
```

- **Demo**
  - ["Sloppy Mode"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Sloppy_mode)
    - don't need to declare variables! If we forget to declare them they end up in the global scope!
    - duplicate parameter names allowed in functions!
  - ALWAYS `'use strict';` - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode
     - (but next week we'll learn about ES6 modules, which run in strict mode by default)
  - Why we don't use `var` to declare variables in this class
    - scoped to function (or global) rather that to a code block like most languages
    - can be referenced *BEFORE* they are declared - which can lead to code errors!
  - `let` and `const` use *block* scope and can only be referenced *AFTER* they are declared - which helps to catch coding errors early!
  - Functions
    - writing functions
    - calling functions
    - are [*first class* data types](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-first-class-function-in-javascript/) in JS
    - can end up in global scope, but it depends on where/how they are declared
    - can be called "before" they are declared (if declared with the `function` keyword)
  - Selecting DOM Elements (DOM = Document Object Model)
    - Selecting DOM elements:
      - `document.querySelector()`
      - `document.querySelectorAll()`
    - Events:
      - DOM elements have to have been loaded by the browser before we can manipulate their properties
      - event handlers - the `onclick` attribute
      - OR `element.addEventListener("click", funcRef)`

<hr>

## VI. Debugging
- JavaScript Debugger:
  - setting breakpoints
  - inspecting variable values 
  - viewing the call stack
  - "View Page Source" v. the Debugger's "Inspect Elements" view

<hr>
  
## VII. Today's Activities
  
- Follow along on today's demo
  - make sure the HTML file is named properly - **`<yourLastname>-<yourFirstInitial>-greeter.html`**
  - ex. "Ace Coder" would name their file **coder-a-greeter.html**
  - Before next time, get the following working:    
    - Add a "last name" input so that we can greet the person using both their first and last name
    - *Declaratively* (using CSS) make the button 50 pixels tall by 100 pixels wide, with a `font-size` of 14 points
    - *Imperatively* (using JavaScript) give the paragraph a red text color, and a yellow background color
- Next time we will finish up the above demo, and assign Practice Exercise 01, which will build on this and reinforce what we've covered here today
- Don't forget to post your ***Introduction*** to Slack! This is how we are taking attendance today
