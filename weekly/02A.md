# Week 2A

## I. Practice Quizzes
- On ***paper***!
- Ungraded
- For quiz 1B, you might not know #3, #4 & #5 because we did not meet last time and talk about JavaScript variable SCOPE - but we'll go over that today!
- Write your name on top and hand it in - I am using it for today's attendance
- We will review the answers in-class
  - *will I publish an answer key for these to myCourses?* Nope! So be sure to take notes in your google doc! `:-)`
- You will see these concepts again in the future, on exam(s)

## II. About JavaScript variable *scope*
- The *scope* of a variable is about its *visibility* and *lifetime* ... meaning
   - where it can be used and
   - how long it will last
- Quick facts
  - `let` is used to declare variables
    - see the [MDN definition of `let`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) - *"The `let` declaration declares re-assignable, block-scoped local variables, optionally initializing each to a value."*
  - `const` is used to declare constants
    - [`const` on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) - *"The `const` declaration declares block-scoped local variables. The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment using the assignment operator, but if a constant is an object, its properties can be added, updated, or removed."*
- `let` and `const` variables cannot be *redeclared* in the same scope
- `let` and `const` variables cannot be accessed prior to their declaration in code - see [hoisting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)
- Let's talk about `var`, even though we don't use it in this class you still need to know about it
  - [`var` on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var) - *"The `var` statement declares function-scoped or globally-scoped variables, optionally initializing each to a value."*
  - *function* scoped, NOT *block* scoped like nearly all languages
    - what other (popular) languages use *function-level* scoping of variables?
  - when used outside of a function, it adds a property to the global `window` object
  - in non-strict mode ("sloppy mode") using a variable name without declaring it gets that variable name created as a global variable on the `window` object!

## III. Notes - More about JS values

### III-A. Falsy values
- "A falsy value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a `Boolean` context"
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy
- In a boolean context, any value that is NOT a falsy value is true
- Examples

```js
const values = [false, 0, -0, undefined, null, NaN, "", '', ``, 0n, 0.0, true, "Ace Coder", 0.00000000000001, "0"];
for (let value of values){
  if(value){
    console.log(`${value} is true`);
   }else{
    console.log(`${value} is false`);
  }
}
```

<hr>

### III-B. `NaN`
- The global `NaN` property is a value representing Not-A-Number.
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN
- There are five different types of operations that return `NaN` (see link above)
- Test for `NaN` with `isNan()` - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/isNaN
- Examples:

```js
2 + 2;  // arithmetic, result is a Number
2 + "two"; // in JS adding a string and a number is string concatenation, so the result is a String
2 * "two"; // in JS with multiplication, division etc this is NaN (but in Python, it returns "twotwo")
2 + undefined; // NaN - a common mistake if a variable or property is unexpectedly undefined - watch for this in your code
2 * undefined; // NaN - a common mistake if a variable or property is unexpectedly undefined - watch for this in your code
Math.sqrt(-1) // NaN
```

- `NaN` demo code you can run:

```js
const expressions = ["2 + 2", "2 + 'two'", "2 * 'two'", "2 + undefined", "2 * undefined", "Math.sqrt(-1)"];
for (let exp of expressions){
  let result = eval(exp); // eval()!
  if(isNaN(result)){
    console.log(`exp = ${exp}. result = ${result} - this evaluates to NaN`);
  }else{
  console.log(`exp = ${exp}. result = ${result} - this is a Number`);
  }
}
```

- Note the use of `eval()`:
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval
  - `eval()` evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string and returns its completion value

<hr>

### III-C. Equality `==` v. Strict Equality `===`

- The equality (`==`) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a `Boolean` result. 
  - Unlike the *strict equality* operator, it attempts to convert and compare operands that are of different types.
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality
- The strict equality (`===`) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a `Boolean` result. 
  - Unlike the *equality* operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality

```js
// Equality
console.log(1 == 1); // true
console.log('hello' == 'hello'); // true
console.log('1' ==  1); // true because JS converts '1' to a Number before doing the comparison
console.log(0 == false); // true because JS converts 0 to a Boolean before doing the comparison

// Strict Equality
console.log(1 === 1); // true
console.log('hello' === 'hello'); // true
console.log('1' ===  1); // false
console.log(0 === false); // false
```

- In this course we won't be specifying which one of these you use, but you definitely need to be aware of the differences
- Many JS style guides require the use of `===` over `==`
- For example: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#comparison-operators--equality

### III-D. Template Strings

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals
- Encloses characters in backticks - `` ` `` - which is next to your keyboard's escape key
- Get used to them - we'll we using them a lot in this course
- Unlike single or double-quoted strings, can be multi-line in your source code. We'll see this in our Web Components - it makes it easy to have nicely formatted HTML templates
- Within the backticks, any JS [*expression*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) (not just a variable name) inside of `${}` is *evaluated*

```js
let greeting = "Hello";
let title = "Potentate";
let firstName = "Ace";
let middleInitial = "B.";
let lastName = "Coder";
// string concatenation
let salutation = greeting + " " + title + " " + firstName + " " + middleInitial + " " + lastName + "!";
// template string
let salutation2 = `${greeting} ${title} ${firstName} ${middleInitial} ${lastName} !`;
```

- *Which one is easier to code and read?*

## IV. Previous Assignments
- [PE-1 Technobabble](../pe/pe-01.md) (we'll talk about this next time)
- Review 1B [Greeter-2](../checkoffs/greeter-2.md) Checkoff
  - "Is there text in the text `<input>`"? 
    - There are lot's of ways to do it!
    - `if(name.length == 0) name = "Peter";`
    - `if(name.length) name = "Peter"; // why does this work?`
    - `name = name.length ? name : "Peter"; // ternary operator`
    - `name = name || "Peter"; // logical OR assignment`
  - replacing `sayHello()` and `sayGoodbye()` with a single function of `greet(greeting)` 
    - using an anonymous function as a "wrapper" for a call to `greet()` is a good way to get this working

## V. Functions & Arrow Functions (time allowing)

- [JS Functions Notes](../notes/js-functions.md)

---

## VI. New Assignment (due prior to start of next class!)

- [PE-02 - More Greeter](../pe/pe-02.md)
  - See requirements linked above
  - Need to follow the [IGME-330 class code standards](../notes/code-style-required-330.md) on this - as an example here's two of the requirements:
    - use `document.querySelector()` and NOT ~~`document.getElementById()`~~ etc
    - in your HTML, `id` and `class` names may not have capital letters - ex.
      - ~~`<button id="btnHello">`~~ is NOT allowed
      - instead use hyphens - "kebab-case" - to separate words - ex.`<button id="btn-hello">`

---

## VII. Demo - start refactoring Greeter-2
- 55 lines of code in my example!
  - Seems somewhat verbose!
- Start by converting the regular functions to arrow functions (and test that it still works!)
- Are there any unnecessary variable declarations?
- Can we simplify the "no name provided" logic?
- Are there any repeated values we could turn into named constants?
