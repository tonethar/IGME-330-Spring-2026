## VI. 2B Checkoff
- **This checkoff is due *TONIGHT***
- Now try out converting an app to ES6 modules
  - Grab these start files: [doubleIt.zip](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/_files/doubleIt.zip)
  - Rename the folder to ***lastName*-*firstInitial*-doubleIt-es6**
  - Open the app in VSCode/Liveserver and be sure that it works
  - Follow the instructions in **main.js** and convert the code to use ES6 module syntax (`import`/`export`)
    - Look at the **statz** demo for ideas how to do `import` and `export`
    - ***Important Note*** -  when you import the **utils** file into **main.js**, you need to use the file extension, and a leading period, meaning **"./utils.js"**, NOT just **"./utils"** (which is what VS Code defaults to)
  - ZIP and post to dropbox
